# Day 15 Heap

## 1046. Last Stone Weight

### 題目
> You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.</br>
We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:</br>
>- If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and</br>
>- If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.</br>
At the end of the game, there is **at most one** stone left.</br>
>
> Return the weight of the last remaining stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.</br>


```c
int lastStoneWeight(int* stones, int stonesSize){

}
```
>Constraints:
>- 1 <= stones.length <= 30
>- 1 <= stones[i] <= 1000
