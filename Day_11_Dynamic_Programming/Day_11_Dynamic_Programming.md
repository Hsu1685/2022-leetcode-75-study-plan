## 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs

### 題目
>You are given an integer array $cost$ where $cost[i]$ is the cost of $i^{th}$ step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps..</br>
You can either start from the step with index $0$, or the step with index $1$..</br>
Return *the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor*.</br>


```c
int minCostClimbingStairs(int* cost, int costSize){

}
```
>Constraints:
>- 2 <= cost.length <= 1000
>- 0 <= cost[i] <= 999

## 62. Unique Paths

### Description
> There is a robot on an $m x n$ grid. The robot is initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., $grid[0][0]$). The robot tries to move to the *bottom-right corner* (i.e., $grid[m - 1][n - 1]$). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.</br>
Given the two integers $m$ and $n$, return *the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner*.</br>
The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to $2 * 10^9$.</br>

```c
int climbStairs(int n){

}
```

>Constraints:
>- 1 <= m, n <= 100
